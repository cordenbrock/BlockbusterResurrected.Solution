<div style="text-align:center">
  <p>Some people say Blockbuster is past its prime, obsolete, antiquated, yada yada yada</p>
  <p>Yet, we know the truth: an institution as divine as Blockbuster will never go under, like plastic serenely drifting atop the ocean waves</p>
  <p>That is why it our mission to revive the brick-and-mortar corpse of what some people are saying is America's true and only pride and joy</p>
  <p>Rent today... please??</p>
